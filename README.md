# Utils
Simple utility files

A collection of files to take care of simple tasks needed on a regular basis for machine learning

At present the only file I have added is to take a set of training data that is organised by a separate folder for each class, 
and to then create a validation set of folders and move a percentage of images from each folder from the training set to the 
validation set
